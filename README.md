# Facebook Delete Messages (Userscript)

This userscript replaces the archive button in Facebook's thread overview with an actual delete button. It is a fork of http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/106261

## Installation
First you need a userscript engine.

  - Chrome already has one included.
  - Use Scriptish or Greasemonkey for Firefox

Then go to https://github.com/untitaker/facebook-delete-messages/raw/master/fbdelmsg.user.js
It should be pretty self-explanatory from there.
